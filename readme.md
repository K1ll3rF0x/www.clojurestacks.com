# www.clojurestacks.com

The purpose of this site is to help Clojure newcomers pick a
collection of libraries to use in their project. We are hoping to
achieve this by collecting descriptions of the stacks of systems built
in Clojure, by documenting the combination of libraries used in each,
 and the pros and cons of each.

See the [introductory post](http://www.clojurestacks.com/misc/2018/05/06/a-call-for-clojure-stacks.html) for details.

Please contribute by PR to the repo, the posts are under `_posts` so
you can look there and figure out the format.
